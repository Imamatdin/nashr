# SlideForge / Nashr — BUILD STATE   (read first, every session)

STATUS: PRODUCTION. Past MVP. No MVP scope, no "works for now." Fix at the correct layer,
verified. Iko runs Claude Code locally against the real repo; master prompts carry acceptance
tests; a step is DONE only when a commit changes this file.

## VERIFIED DONE (evidence, not memory)
- Decimal truncation "73.8 bar" — fixed 8f5b587, renders intact slide 2.
- Collision/clip/overflow stacking — committed, margins documented.
- 6 interactive formats render (Enlightenment deck = proof).
- git: laptop == origin == server, clean.

## CONFIRMED BROKEN — by layer (sCO2 deck: layout.json + last_deck.json)
| # | Symptom | Layer | Cost | Evidence |
|---|---------|-------|------|----------|
| A | data-emphasis: unit drawn twice ("1.58PUE"+"PUE"), labels stranded | RENDERER | free | data-emphasis.ts concat + fixed-fraction y |
| B | "Key takeaway / preceding data underscores..." hollow slide | CODE→EDITORIAL | free interim / paid real | editorial.py _insert_breathing_after_data hardcoded stub |
| C | numbered list 1,2,4,5 — model dropped its own #3 | MODEL | PAID | last_deck.json bullets has 4 items |
| C2| literal "1. " prefixes baked into bullets | MODEL + code guard | paid+free | same bullets |
| D | chart slide: stats=null, chart_series=null, data in prose, sCO2 value dropped | MODEL | PAID | last_deck.json STATS null, BODY dangling pipe |
| E | "[Chart placeholder]" — chart renderer unbuilt | UNBUILT (Step 2) | free | chart-data.ts placeholder by design |
| F | chart title collides with chart box (2-line title under-measured) | RENDERER (Step 11) | free | floor logic correct, fed wrong title height |

## SHIPPED
- A (data-emphasis value/unit split + measured CENTERED stacking) — 48f713b. Verified:
  worker `layout` on crafted sCO2 deck = no jammed units, each unit in one block,
  gaps ~1.2%; chromium screenshot reads number→unit→label→comparison clean.
- C2 (stripListPrefix at all four bullet/point sites, not just summary) — 48f713b.
  "1. " stripped, "1.08" preserved; screenshot shows single "• " markers.
- B-interim (breather seeded from real stat; skip when no stat) — 48f713b. INTERIM:
  real model-authored breathing content is plan item 2. Carries the R27 trade noted above.
- Over-long single-token line undercount — c79036c. measureText kept any token wider
  than the effective maxWidth on ONE line (old "we don't simulate character breaking"
  path); browser/PPTX/LibreOffice character-break it, so blocks stacked beneath a
  wrapped value were under-measured. Now counts ceil(width/maxWidth) lines, width
  capped at maxWidth, off-by-one handled. Part of plan item 11 (fontkit accuracy).
  CORRECTION to the original report: the "1.56–1.58" data-emphasis collision was a
  MISDIAGNOSIS — that value is 307.7px vs a ~419px column, renders one line, and the
  real LayoutPass already stacks it with no overlap (item A). Verified: vitest run of
  a 3-stat fixture with a genuinely over-long value (`1.560–1.580–1.600`) — the number
  measures 2 lines and the unit clears its measured bottom. The remaining text-measure
  red (sCO2 title, 1 vs 2) is a SEPARATE facet of item 11 (multi-token wrap-width
  calibration / F), still open.

## PLAN
1. [x] Free batch: A · C2 · B-interim — DONE 48f713b
2. [ ] Paid editorial pass: B-real (model writes breathing takeaways) · C (no dropped items) · D (structured chart series)
3. [ ] Step 2 chart renderer (free) — SVG bars from series; folds in F via Step 11 measurement
4-12. [ ] image engine (3/4/5) · intent (6/7) · grounding (8) · convo edit (9) · honest failure (10) · fontkit accuracy (11) · font library (12)

## NOTES (load-bearing, don't rediscover the hard way)
- The "free verification loop against debug/last_deck.json" assumes a banked sCO2 deck;
  `debug/` is gitignored and that file is NOT in a fresh checkout. The durable free loop is:
  vitest (`npx vitest run`), the worker `layout` CLI on `__tests__/fixtures/enlightenment.json`,
  and pytest. A crafted data_emphasis fixture lives in `layout-data-emphasis.test.ts`.
- B-interim TRADE (R27 weakened, deliberate): breathers now inject only when the preceding
  data slide carries a usable `stats` entry. CHART_DATA / TABLE_COMPACT hold numbers in
  prose/rows, not `stats`, so a chart→table run gets NO auto breather. Absent beats hollow.
  The model-authored breather in plan item 2 restores coverage for those gaps.
- Still-red, unrelated to the over-long fix: `text-measure.test.ts` sCO2-title-line-count
  (1 vs 2). This is the MULTI-token wrap-width calibration facet of plan item 11 (F) — the
  title fits the renderer's box but exceeds nominal*0.78, so the measurer counts 2 lines.
  The over-long SINGLE-token facet is fixed (c79036c); this title case is a different one
  (RENDER_WIDTH_SAFETY tuning) and remains open. Do not attribute to A/C2/B or to c79036c.

## STATUS IS TRUTH: `git log -- docs/BUILD_STATE.md` shows what shipped. Not chat memory.
